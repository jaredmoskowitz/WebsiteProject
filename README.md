WebsiteProject
==============

This is a prototype for a customer website that I created while working for MegaPath.

It achieves the following objectives:

-takes in a location address and name then maps that address using geocoding and gmaps4rails
-take in an excel, csv, or several other file types with a certain format and then maps the contained mutliple
  addresses to multiple locations on a map
-each location has a popup window with tables to display open quotes, saved quotes, bills, purchase history, and 
  support history
    -These are not actually functional, but the databases behind them are set up
-a user can use the services without logging in. Once they are done they can enter an email address and the
  host will send a password for the new user's account
-you can sign into an account to see what locations and related data you have saved
